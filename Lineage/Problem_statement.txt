Requirement 1 — Output must include “Field Name”
 Meaning: For each mapped column you output, you must include an additional field like:
•	FieldName (or whatever field name is used in the mapping file)
So each output row should have at least:
•	mappedColumn (the name you are trying to match)
•	FieldName (the original/actual/real field name from the mapping input)
•	matching details (below)

Requirement 2 — Output must show all columns (not only >=80%)
Even if your code is technically returning all columns split across lists, the requirement is:
 Meaning: For every mapped column from the mapping file:
•	You must output a row even if it has no good match
•	Don’t “drop” columns just because the score is low
So the output should include:
•	Strong matches
•	Weak/possible matches
•	No-match cases


Requirement 3 — For low confidence cases, show candidate matches (NVL-style) Meaning:
•	If matchScore < 80, output should still show:
o	a list of likely candidate columns (top N)
o	their tables
o	their scores
So reviewers can quickly decide the correct mapping.
